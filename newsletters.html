    <h2>Artist Spotlight | Mary Cassatt</h2>
         <p class="overview">Highlighting the life and work of Mary Cassatt, this article was written in correspondance with an effort by the Museum to spotlight the contributions of women artists in its permanent collection.
        </p>
            <div class="writing-sample">
                <p>Perhaps one of the most beloved artists of the 19th
                century, Mary Cassatt (1844-1926) surpassed every
                expectation for women artists of her time. Born to a
                wealthy family, Cassatt's father was staunchly against
                the prospect of his daughter pursuing a career as an
                artist; despite this, at the early age of 15, she would
                begin attending the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine
                Arts, where only 20% of students were women. Among
                even these limited numbers, Cassatt was one of the
                few so determined to pursue a career as an artist,
                typically deemed unsuitable for a woman. Additionally,
                women were barred from certain settings here such
                as nude figure drawing sessions, and were required to
                work from plaster models instead. 
                <br></br>Feeling her education had been lacking in
                Pennsylvania, Cassatt would travel abroad to Paris
                to continue her artistic studies. Here, once again,
                she would find the opportunities afforded to her to
                be severely limited, as women were banned from
                studying in formal classroom settings at the École
                Nationale Supérieure des Beaux Arts, the leading
                art school in Paris. To work around this limitation,
                she took private lessons from some of the most
                distinguished artists of the time and copied the
                works of old masters. 
                <br></br>With time, she would begin to gain the recognition
                that she deserved; in 1877, she was the only American
                invited to join the Impressionists, a group of artists
                whose work rebelled against academic subject matter
                and embraced modernity. It is during this period
                of time that Cassatt would refine her technique
                and work, and, in 1890, she would pivot and begin
                focusing on works depicting the bonds between
                mother and children, the subject matter for which she
                is most widely recognized today. Upon her eventual
                return to America, she would become one of the
                leading voices of Impressionism, her influence shaping
                the growing art scene in America. </p>

                    traditional Mardi Gras mask, and commemorate the
                    night with a photo taken in the Alter-Ego photo
                    booth! Guests can also get their fortune told with

                    Men's Basketball Tournament will be on the big
                    screen, and breweries will be paired against one
                    another in a friendly tournament-style competition.
                    Guests will be given a “Brewery Bracket” to fill out
                    and determine which beers make it to the “Final
                    Pour,” and who is the ultimate winner!<br></br>

                    pub glass.</p>
