  <p class="overview">
    As a former English major, who spent the majority of my academic history studying the liberal arts, 
    I never envisioned I would one day consider myself a web designer or "programmer" in any capacity.
    <br></br>
    However, at my previous role, there came a point where our website was due for a major overhaul,
    and there was no one familiar with the platform it was hosted on (Craft CMS).
    Seeing an opportunity to learn new skills, I decided to rise to the task. 
    It is here that I discovered a passion for web, and discovering the best ways to organize and display information. I took immense satisfaction
    in not only writing copy for web, but also designing the page around it. I learned a lot on the job, and loved every second of it.
    <br></br>
    Since leaving that position, I have spent my spare time self-studying the technical side of web development, including 
    HTML, CSS, Git and Github. Below you can find a sample of my personal and professional work in this field.

  <h2>Porfolio Website</h2>
       <div class="overview">
            <div class="writing-sample">
                My portfolio website, which you are currently viewing consists of HTML and CSS, and is currently hosted via Github pages.
                Previously, I had created a site using Wixsite, however, I wanted to put my skills to the test and create something entirely my own.
                <br></br>
                When designing the layout of the site, my goal was to strike a balance between professionality and personality.
                My font choice paired with white and light grey backgrounds are intended to give the site a clean feeling; the pops of green infuse it with a sense of liveliness. 
                <br><img id="room" src="../../resources/media/room.png"/>
                When designing the landing page I was very mindful of the fact that it is the first thing 
                any visitors will see. Included is a 3D model of my workspace which I created myself using Blender.
                I was excited to include this as it was a chance to utilize yet another skill which I have been learning on my own,
                while also showcasing a little bit about myself: my dog, my love of plants and my love of books.
                I also hoped that this would create a cozy environment to welcome visitors to my page with.
                <br></br>
                While the website is currently complete for viewing in a browser, there are many parts that are not yet optimized for mobile,
                which will be my next major project moving forward.

    <h2>Webpage Makeover for the New Britain Museum of American Art</h2>
        <p class="overview">
            Below is a sample of a webpage redesign done while working at the NBMAA. While the bulk of the content 
            remains unchanged, the intent was to create a page which was more more visual in nature.
            The graphics were created using Adobe Photoshop, and the layout was created in HTML5.
