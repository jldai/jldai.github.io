  <p class="overview">
    Throughout my professional career I have discovered an immense satisfaction
    in writing copy for web; I enjoy creating new web pages as well as
    finding ways to improve old websites in equal parts.
    <br></br>
    Through web content writing, I find ways to improve layout, navigitability, and efficiency of the written word.
    <br></br>
    I have spent my spare time self-studying the technical side of web development, including 
    HTML, CSS, Git and Github. Below you can find a sample of my personal and professional work in this field.
  </p> 

  
  <h2>Porfolio Website</h2>
       <div class="overview">
            <div class="writing-sample">
                My portfolio website, which you are currently viewing consists of HTML and CSS, and is currently hosted via Github pages.
                Previously, I had created a site using Wixsite, however, I wanted to put my skills to the test and create something entirely my own.
                <br></br>
                When designing the layout of the site, my goal was to strike a balance between professionality and personality.
                My font choice paired with white and light grey backgrounds are intended to give the site a clean feeling; the pops of green infuse it with a sense of liveliness. 
                <br><img id="room" src="../../resources/media/room.png"/>
                When designing the landing page I was very mindful of the fact that it is the first thing 
                any visitors will see. Included is a 3D model of my workspace which I created myself using Blender.
                I was excited to include this as it was a chance to utilize yet another skill which I have been learning on my own,
                while also showcasing a little bit about myself: my dog, my love of plants and my love of books.
                I also hoped that this would create a cozy environment to welcome visitors to my page with.
                <br></br>
                While the website is currently complete for viewing in a browser, there are many parts that are not yet optimized for mobile,
                which will be my next major project moving forward.

    <h2>Webpage Makeover for the New Britain Museum of American Art</h2>
        <p class="overview">
            Below is a sample of a webpage redesign done while working at the NBMAA, as well as an
            explanation of my process when approaching the redesign.
            <br></br>
                <div class="writing-sample">
                    <h3>Before</h3>
                              In this original iteration, visitors to this site are greeted with a wall of text. While
                              the links serve to lead visitors out of the page, they are lost in the sea of words. There
                              is no urgent sense of call to action, and the page is visually unappealing. <br> </br>
                        <img src="../../resources/media/schoolvisit-before.jpg"/>
                  </div>
                  <div class="writing-sample">
                    <h3>After</h3>
                        Although the written content itself is much the same, this redesign is much more visually appealing. 
                        The links are more clearly isolated, and supported by images that also tell a story. 
                        Additionally, I lightly edited the color grading of each image to create a sense of visual cohesiveness 
                        despite their general vibrancy. <br></br>
                        While the inclusion of images tell a story that the copy cannot, they also strengthen the 
                        call to action by drawing additional attention to themselves. <br></br>
